TOR SUPPORT IN BITCOIN
======================

It is possible to run Neutrinocoin as a Tor hidden service, and connect to such services.

The following directions assume you have a Tor proxy running on port 9050. Many distributions
default to having a SOCKS proxy listening on port 9050, but others may not.
In particular, the Tor Browser Bundle defaults to listening on a random port. See
https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#TBBSocksPort for how to properly
configure Tor.


1. Run neutrinocoin behind a Tor proxy
---------------------------------

The first step is running Neutrinocoin behind a Tor proxy. This will already make all
outgoing connections be anonimized, but more is possible.

-socks=5        SOCKS5 supports connecting-to-hostname, which can be used instead
                of doing a (leaking) local DNS lookup. SOCKS5 is the default,
                but SOCKS4 does not support this. (SOCKS4a does, but isn't
                implemented).

-tor=ip:port    Set the proxy server to use for tor hidden services.

-connect=X      When behind a Tor proxy, you can specify .onion addresses instead
-addnode=X      of IP addresses or hostnames in these parameters. It requires
-seednode=X     SOCKS5. In Tor mode, such addresses can also be exchanged with
                other P2P nodes.

In a typical situation, this suffices to run behind a Tor proxy:

  ./neutrinocoind -tor=127.0.0.1:9050


2. Run a neutrinocoin hidden server
------------------------------

If you configure your Tor system accordingly, it is possible to make your node also
reachable from the Tor network. Add these lines to your /etc/tor/torrc (or equivalent
config file):

  HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/neutrinocoin-service/
  HiddenServicePort 8777 127.0.0.1:8777

The directory can be different of course, but (both) port numbers should be equal to
your neutrinocoind's P2P listen port (8777 by default).

-externalip=X   You can tell neutrinocoin about its publicly reachable address using
                this option, and this can be a .onion address. Given the above
                configuration, you can find your onion address in
                /var/lib/tor/neutrinocoin-service/hostname. Onion addresses are given
                preference for your node to advertize itself with, for connections
                coming from unroutable addresses (such as 127.0.0.1, where the
                Tor proxy typically runs).

In a typical situation, where you're only reachable via Tor, this should suffice:

  ./neutrinocoind -tor=127.0.0.1:9050 -externalip=57qr3yd1nyntf5k.onion

(obviously, replace the Onion address with your own).
